# 📊 Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository! 🚀  
This project showcases a comprehensive end-to-end **data warehousing and analytics solution**, transforming raw enterprise data into clean, structured, and business-ready datasets. The architecture highlights best practices in **data engineering, transformation, and consumption** to enable meaningful insights through **BI tools**, **ad-hoc SQL querying**, and **machine learning workflows**.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The architecture follows a **layered approach** for scalability, modularity, and clarity:

### 🧱 Layers Breakdown

- **Bronze Layer**:  
  - Contains raw ingested data as-is from CRM and ERP systems.  
  - Object Type: `Table`  
  - Load Type: `Batch`, `Full Load`, `Truncate & Insert`  
  - No transformations applied.  

- **Silver Layer**:  
  - Data is cleaned, standardized, normalized, and enriched.  
  - Object Type: `Table`  
  - Load Type: `Batch`, `Full Load`, `Truncate & Insert`  
  - Transformations include:  
    - Data Cleaning  
    - Standardization  
    - Normalization  
    - Derived Columns  
    - Enrichment  

- **Gold Layer**:  
  - Provides business-ready views.  
  - Object Type: `Views`  
  - Transformations applied:  
    - Data Integration  
    - Aggregations  
    - Business Logic  
  - Data Model:  
    - Star Schema  
    - Flat Table  
    - Aggregated Tables
